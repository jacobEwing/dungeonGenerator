This is a simple library for generating terrains.  The goal is for there to be
multiple types of terrain, but as of this writing there are two:

 - Dungeons
 - forest

Those are generated using some standalone code, found in either generator.js or
generator.php.  Note that each of those files is independent of the other, and
performs the same task.  They each contain functions for generating terrain,
and are simply translations of each other.  Either one of them can be used in
your code as a standalone file, and the functions therein should work.
