This is a simple library for generating dungeon crawler terrains.  The goal is
for there to be multiple types of terrain, but as of this writing there are
three:

 - dungeon
 - forest
 - swamp

Those are generated using some standalone code, found in either generator.js or
generator.php.  Note that each of those files is independent of the other, and
performs the same task.  They each contain functions for generating terrain,
and are simply translations of each other.  Either one of them can be used in
your code as a standalone file, and the functions therein should work.

The output of the functions are arrays of ASCII characters representing
different types of texture.  For example, a walkable floor or road is a ".", a
brick wall is "#", a tree is "T" and so on.
